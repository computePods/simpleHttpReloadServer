  A monkey patched version of the `Starlette::FileResponse.__call__` method.

  This version detects if the media_type is HTML and if so, reads the file
  line by line looking for the `</head>` element. When found the `</head>`
  string is replaced by a `<script>...</script></head>` string which
  contains the `reloaderScript` from the `cphttp.reloader`

  If the file is *not* an HTML file, the original
  `Starlette::FileResponse.__call__` is called.

  This code is based on the original `Starlette::FileResponse.__call__`
  code. It is used under Starlette's BSD License (see the top of the
